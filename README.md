A mod for Minecraft created by the Cryptic Mushroom

## Why is this mod not finished yet?
A lot of us have a lot of stuff going on in our personal lives, so development is increasingly slow. If you'd like to send pull requests to help us out, that's be much appreciated.

## Can I contribute to this mod?
Yeah sure! A lot of help can be used in creating this mod, since it is so big. Just please **do not** send pull requests that **only have redundant things** (i.e. reformatting the code base, adding comments, etc.). We also ask that you please keep the coding style as is, not changing the placement of brackets unless absolutely necessary.

## Can I have a .jar of this mod?
Well, we won't give you one, but if you know how to build this mod using gradle, knock yourself out. If you are testing the mod, I recommend using the MultiMC launcher.
